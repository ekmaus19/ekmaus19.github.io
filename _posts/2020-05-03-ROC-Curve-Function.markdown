# SUMMARY
Part of a function created for the QAC Stats package created by the Advanced R course at Wesleyan University. The package was created with interviews of Wesleyan professors with regards to what tools would best serve student learning and assist their teaching.

This specific function allows a user to plot multiple ROC curves on the same graphic, as well as see important statistics (Area Under Curve, Sensitivity, Specificity) for each plotted model in the R console upon execution.
