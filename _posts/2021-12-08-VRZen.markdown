Final project for Introduction to Virtual Environments (INF 385T) at The University of Texas at Austin, Fall 2021. See more [here](https://ekmaus19.itch.io/vrzen).

## Overview

VRZen works to foster a calming space specically designed for students. The project aims to **fill the support gap between contacting university mental health services and attending the first appointment**, although the platform has potential to be used indefinitely. This prototype is a first step in addressing student needs while reducing reliance on physical university spaces by way of:

● Refuge within a calming virtual space available 24/7

● Peer support from other students using the app at their university

● Virtually guided meditation and mindfulness exercises 

● Compiled resources for further self-care, in VR and beyond 

By providing a readily available resource to university students experiencing psychological duress, VRZen attempts to help manage some of the student’s most pressing stressors until they are able to
receive professional help.

## Contribution Statement

My specific contributions to the demo include:

● Constructing/designing the waiting room and quiet room

● Designing the portal mechanisms and connecting the outside meditative environments

● Setting up the movement of and interactions with the NPC support animal

● Mocking UI elements and providing information on proposed features

● Integrating all scenes for Oculus Quest, including grabbing capabilities

● Capturing footage of the project for the promotional video using Unity Timeline

● Conceptualizing additional avenues for demo expansion, including a "take a sweet/leave a sweet" feature (where students can share audio notes attached to a piece of candy)
