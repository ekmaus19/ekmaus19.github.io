A sampling of exploratory projects done as part of research for Wesleyan University's [Traveler's Lab](https://travelerslab.research.wesleyan.edu/).

# Project 1: Paston Letters
![Actor Network](/assets/images/actor_network.png)

As part of an ongoing project of the Traveler’s Lab analyzing medieval communication networks, the above network details with some interactivity an “actor network” approach to connecting all entries in an existing letter correspondence data set of the Paston Family. This approach attempts to weigh people and places equally to assess the significance of each on the overall social system. In addition to primarily academic exploration, the plot is substantially large, so only a still with a selected node is provided. The visual was generated in R in the summer of 2017 as part of the research conducted by Professor Gary Shaw.

# Project 2: Caesarius

A supplemental visualization for the work of visiting Professor Helen Birkett. This project detailed the records of Caesarius of Heistrbach, specifically the “Dialogue of Miracles,” to assess contacts mentioned in the text. A detailed summary can be found on the Traveler’s Lab website. This interactive R network visualization allows for a more granular look at the connections present in the data set compiled by the lab.

Networks from this project were included in the Traveler’s Lab presentation of the 42nd Social Science History Association in Montreal. [Read more](https://travelerslab.research.wesleyan.edu/2017/11/07/ssha-in-montreal-november-5/).
